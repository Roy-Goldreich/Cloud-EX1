Currently has an error with connecting to the RDS database when auto-deploying the database.
This did not happen when I deployed my instancses manualy but I didn't manage to fix this on the auto deployment :(
Before running setup.sh I assume you defined in you aws config the following parameters :
master_username - Holds master username for RDS
master_password - Holds master passowrd for RDS
